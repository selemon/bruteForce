The changes that i have made in the EchoClient.java class is
from line 33-37 where i changed what is being written to the
server

the code is the following:
			out.println("Knock, knock");
			System.out.println(in.readLine());
			out.println("Adore");
			System.out.println(in.readLine());
			out.println("Adore is between us. Open up!");
			
The changes that i have made in the connection.java class is
from line 47-51 where i changed what the connection checks for
when it recives a joke

the code is the following:
				if (line.equals("Knock, knock")) {
					response = "Who's there?";
				} else if (line.equals("Adore")) {
					response = "Adore who?";
				} else if (line.equals("Adore is between us. Open up!")) {
	
			
			
The changes that i have made in the Search.java class is 
in line 38 and line 43. in line 38 i parse for a forth argument
that should be passed from the user which is the range. In line 
43 i have replaced the for loop from lopping till i 100 to 
looping till i reaches range which is the user selected value

Evidence of correctness:
	The program is still working correctly and this is evident by
	the outputs the program is producing for example the echoserver
	and echocliet now make the new knock knock joke and it is clearly
	evident its working when you run it
